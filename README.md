# Pages
A single file request handler

This is a directory content helper that builds on [Placeholder](https://github.com/cypnk/Placeholder), which allows for more than one page to be served with minimal intervention.

There are no databases, cookies, sessions etc... This is a simple handler for serving HTML content and static files uploaded to a server.
